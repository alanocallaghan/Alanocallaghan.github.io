# About me
![IGMM portrait](/assets/img/alan.jpg){: .portrait }


I am a bioinformatician with some 
experience as a service provider, who moved on to pursue a PhD in
[Catalina Vallejos' group](https://vallejosgroup.github.io/) in the 
[MRC Human Genetics Unit](https://www.ed.ac.uk/mrc-human-genetics-unit).
My PhD related to Bayesian analysis of single cell RNA sequencing,
with a particular focus on inference of variability and scalable inference.

I am currently employed as a postdoctoral researcher with Elena Vigorito 
and Chris Wallace at the MRC Biostatistics Unit, working again on scalable
Bayesian inference, but also in this case on eQTL analysis for immune-mediated
disease.

I am also interested in the R programming language and data visualisation,
and have made contributions to a number of R packages, in particular those
relating to visualisations and interactive graphics. I worked previously
with [Fios Genomics](https://www.fiosgenomics.com/), and I was
lucky enough in that position to be able to develop my programming, 
data analysis and visualisation, and presentation skills.

Thanks for visiting my personal website. Please get in touch if you have any
questions.
